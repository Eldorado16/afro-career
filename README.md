Advanced technology is used in creating online opportunities for young people helping solve the unemployment crisis in developing 
states. Majority of young people are willing and equipped with

## The context

This is our portfolio project that concludes our foundations Year at ALX-Holberton School. We were at liberty to choose our desired partners and choose a project to work on, as long as we presented a working program by the end of the specified three weeks.
## The Team
As a team we warm up to online experiences, freelancing with alot of passion in coding while keeping it fun!
